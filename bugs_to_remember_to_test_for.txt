1.  Correct return values for all functions
2.  Creating more processes than allowed
3.  Setting child_max_proc() to:
    a. The same value twice
    b. A negative value
    c. Zero
4.  Call child_max_proc() lots of times before a fork() call
5.  Make sure orphaned process correctly gets it's grandfather's 
    limit
6.  Test correct clone handling
7.  Make sure get_max_proc() returns the actual limitation imposed
    on the process, not it's children
8.  Make sure get_max_proc() returns new limitations imposed on
    an orphaned process
9.  Make sure get_subproc() correctly counts:
    a. Zombie processes (at this point I don't know if they
	   count or not)
	b. Processes added to the subtree via brother-adoption (can
	   happen after cloning, maybe)
10. Try creating a situation where a process has more than the
    allowed number of processes (can be done with CLONE) and make
	sure the process can't make more until enough of it's children
	have died
