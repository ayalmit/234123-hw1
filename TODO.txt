TODO:
1. The do_fork check where we test whether or not we can fork a process:
   must it be atomic? Can we assume we'll complete the tests + field updates
   in one go? Otherwise, two processes may think they can fork themselves
   when really only one can...
2. Same question for child field updates: when we set older_sibling for
   a process, maybe another sibling is being created at the same time...
